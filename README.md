# Todo list React + TypeScript + Vite

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, and thank you for checking out my Todo list React + TypScript + Vite practice repository.

### Description

---

The idea of this is a way for me to work on using TypeScript with React. I also wanted to get hands-on with CSS Modules, which work out of the box with Vite. Another cool idea I wanted to try was using the [HTML Drag and Drop API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API). In looking at how boxes are moved, you can move the todos by clicking a button to place them in another spot, but I wanted to learn about `drag events` and how to allow boxes to be moved by dragging.

### Getting Started

---

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install` in your terminal from the `root` directory.
3. After installing, run `npm run dev` to start a development server at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Technologies

---

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that helps developers build web applications quickly and efficiently.

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a programming language
  developed by Microsoft that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It is a typed superset of JavaScript, which means that all valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. TypeScript adds optional static typing to JavaScript, which can help to catch errors early and make your code more maintainable.

- [React](https://react.dev/) is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components that update efficiently and in a declarative manner. With React, you can build interactive and dynamic web applications, making it especially popular for single-page applications where user interfaces need to be responsive and flexible.

- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) is a methodology for locally scoping styles in web development. It enables you to encapsulate styles within specific components or modules, preventing naming conflicts and providing a cleaner separation of concerns. Each component gets its own unique CSS scope, and class names are automatically generated during the build process, ensuring styles are applied locally without impacting the rest of your application.
